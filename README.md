<p>How many of you have the <b>Nokia1100</b> as his first cellphone? I don't know you, but was my first phone. <br>
    But if you didn't, you maybe ask, what it's the deal with that phone, well let me tell you, that phone have two
    awesome features a flashlight and wait for it... THE SNAKE GAME

<p>This reconstruction of the snake it's a part of the program called <b>JSSOCIETY</b> in which we just play with
    <b>Javascript</b> for fun
</p>

<span>The game was builded in <b>Vanilla JS</b> and if you play it with your phone(or check it with the devtools) you
    are gonna to find a special easter egg from the 90's</span>
